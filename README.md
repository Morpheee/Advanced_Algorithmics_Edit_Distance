# Advanced_Algorithmics_Edit_Distance
Advanced Algorithmics Project : Implement and compare multiple algorithms to compute the edit distance and an alignement between two strings, create test sets to run experiments to compare time and space complexity, run experiments on protein database, cluster protein sequences based on edit distance and other methods.
